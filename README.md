# git-lesson

1. Open your terminal and `cd` to your "workspace" where all of your project folders are kept. Clone the repository into your workspace with `git clone`. You now have a complete copy of my online repository. You can see w/ `ls` that it only has one file so far.
```
% git clone https://github.com/crvarner/git-lesson.git
% cd git-lesson
% ls
```

LARGE RED SACK, HECK YEAH!

I prefer small blue sacks...? Why though???
